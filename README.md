# Faction Turn Simulator

This is a project in progress, started as coursework for the course TKO_8971, Applied Project at the University of Tutku, Department of Future Technologies.

## Goal

The plan is to create a tool for Game Masters in tabletop RPGs that they can use to simulate how so called factions affect the game world between play sessions. 

## Current features

* Editable hexmap
	* alter color of cells
	* add town icon
	* add units

* Simple random movement

## TODO:

* Everything else. :P

### Acknowledgments:

The hex map was based on the excellent tutorial by [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/)
